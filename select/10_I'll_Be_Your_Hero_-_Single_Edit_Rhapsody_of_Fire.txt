Heal my disgrace rainfall of fire
Nightmares and dreams in my pounding desire
Can’t stop this race while worlds collide
Monsters and heroes in this great divide
Live a life beyond the gatego the distance everywhere
Running wild and fight to choose your fate
One day I’ll be your hero
Burning fast, take my place in the world
One day I’ll win for you
Turning tears into dreams with my hand
One day
Wind of the night, my ancient sail
Wipe out the mist let me rip off this veil
Waves seem like walls, facing the storm
Choose your own path make it worth and return
It doesn't matter who you are: be the hunter, not the prey
Look at the results achieved so far
One day I’ll be your hero
Burning fast, take my place in the world
One day I’ll win for you
Turning tears into dreams with my hand
One day
Live a life beyond the gate go the distance everywhere
Running wild and fight to choose your fate
It doesn't matter who you are: be the hunter, not the prey
Look at the results achieved so far
One day I’ll be your hero,
Burning fast, take my place in the world
One day I’ll win for you
Turning tears into dreams with my hand
One day
